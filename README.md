# SmartUnversity
This project was made with Aymen Ouaden and acts as our final Licence project in **NTIC.**
As part of the Workshop of our third year in software engineering, we were asked to make a webapp and if possible an android app that would be used in a *Smart University*, the goal is simple : **SIMPLIFY** with modern tech the absences management on a faculty level!
This project is made up of three parts:

- An API built with Jersey.
- A website made with J2EE.
- An android app made with Android Studio.

This project aims to help both students and teachers to keep track of their absences and their justifications, sessions, program, requests...

Both the android app and the website are still very unstable and might be glitchy on the edges.
